This tutorial shows you how to get started with the programming language Python. Python is a great choice if you have never coded before: it's free, it reads like real English and it's fast and simple to learn the basics. What's more, Python often figures in the top three of the most in-demand languages by recruiters.

Read on to learn how to install Python on your computer, and learn and practice some of the basic concepts of this programming language.

## 1: Installing Python

The first essential step is to install Python on your computer - but why, and what does this mean exactly? In order to code with Python, we need our machine to be able to **interpret** Python, that is to say to read our code, check that the code obeys the rules of Python, and carry out the actions we asked for in the code. To this end, we must **install Python** on our machine.

We give you two main options for installing Python:

### Option A: Download and install from python.org

Python.org is the home of the official **Python Software Foundation**, which produces and maintains Python. 

Follow their [beginners guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) to download and install the correct version of the Python interpreter for your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux).

### Option B: Download and install via Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) bundles together the basic Python interpreter with some other useful tools which can make the Python experience more user-friendly, notably:

- **Extra packages** such as NumPy, pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib. At a basic level, you can think of packages like "add-ons", letting you use extra commands and functions in your code that don't come with the basic Python installation. For example, the NumPy package gives you a range of complex mathematic functions and random number generators. 
- **Conda**: a package manager, which makes it easy for you to install and manage other Python packages in the future.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: an application which runs in your web browser, and gives you a user-friendly alternative to writing and running all your code in the terminal command line.

To download Anaconda (and benefit from the Python interpreter plus these extra features), download and install the correct version depending on your operating system [on this page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

## 2: Getting ready to code: opening the Python Interactive Shell

We will be coding from the **terminal**, also referred to as the **command line** or **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface. We'll start off by using the **Python Interactive Shell**, which is great for testing quick snippets of code. Later, we'll show how you can write and save all your code in a text file, and just use the terminal to run the code.

TODO: check all this for an anaconda installation on Windows

1. Open the **terminal** on your computer.

    <Message type="tip">
      The terminal application usually has an icon similar to this: <Lightbox src="scaleway-terminal.webp" alt="" />.
    </Message>

2. Type `python3` and hit enter. An output similar to the following  displays, showing that you are in the Python Interactive Shell:

      ```bash
      Python 3.9.12 (main, <date>, <time>) 
      [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on <OS>
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>>
      ```

      <Message type="tip">
        Python is now on its third major release version, which is the version that will have been installed on your machine during the previous step, hence `python3`. Different operating systems may handle the naming of Python differently: you may be able to use the shorter `python` command on Windows, for example. To exit the interactive shell at any time, type `exit()` and hit enter.
      </Message>

You're now ready to start coding with Python!

## 3: Hello world and the print() command

You might have heard people talk about "Hello world" before. When learning a new programming language, "Hello World" generally refers to the most basic task possible: coding something that displays "Hello world" on the screen. You can think of it as the entry-level onboarding task to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of the language.

So how do we get python to display "Hello World"? The answer is: via the `print()` command. This has nothing to do with printing onto paper, and everything to do with displaying text. You can think of it like "printing" something to the screen. 

- The brackets `()` contain the text you want to print
- The text must be contained in quotation marks `" "` or `' '`

1. Type `print("Hello world")` and hit enter. The following output displays:

    ```bash
    >>> print("Hello world")
    Hello world
    ```

    Congratulations, you're now a Python programmer!

2. Use the `print(" ")` command to practice displaying any text of your choice.

## 4: Variables and assignment

Variables are used to store and label data. They are a key part of any programming language: they help us to organize and manipulate data, in a way that is readable by a human but understandable by the programming language.

1. Type `my_new_variable = "Hello world"` and hit enter.

    No output displays. This is because you have **created** a new variable (with the label `my_new_variable`) and **assigned** it (with the `=` operator) a **value** (`Hello world`) but you haven't asked Python to do anything with that variable. Let's try that in the next step.

2. Type `print(my_new_variable)` and hit enter. The following output displays:

    ```bash
    >>> print(my_new_variable)
    Hello world
    ```

    When we ask Python to print the variable, it displays the value of that variable! Note that this time we didn't use quotation marks in our print statement: these are only necessary for strings, not for variables or numbers.

    <Message type="tip">

    The variable holds **string** data. Let's look at just some of the different types of data we can store inside a variable, and how the data type affects the syntax of creating and assigning variables.

    | Type    | Description                                                                                      | Example of variable assignment           |
    |---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | int     | A whole number                                                                                   | `my_variable = 3`                          |
    | float   | A decimal number                                                                                 | `my_variable = 2.667`                      |
    | string  | A character, or sequence of characters. Represents text, not numbers to be used in calculation.  | `my_variable = "I saw 7 sheep"`            |
    | boolean | A true or false value.                                                                           | `my_variable = True`                       |
    | list    | A collection of values. These values could be ints, floats, strings, booleans etc, or a mixture. | `my_variable = [1, 7, "hello", 2.5, True]` |

    With Python, there is no need to specify what type of variable you are creating. It automatically understands from the syntax of the creation statement (for example, whether there are quotation marks, whether a number has a decimal point) what type the variable should be.

    These are not all the data types available in Python, but they are the main ones you'll need to get started with the basics.

    </Message>

    You can change the value of a variable from one thing to another. Here, we change `my_new_variable` so that instead of holding the string "Hello world", it now contains the float (decimal number) 3.5:

3. Type `my_new_variable = 3.5` and hit enter. 

    Remember that no quotation marks should be used for number variables.

4. Type `print(my_new_variable)` and hit enter. The following output displays:

    ```bash
    >>> my_new_variable = 3.5
    >>> print(my_new_variable)
    3.5
    ```

    Let's see how you can use Python to do mathematical operations on number variables. It's pretty simple!

5. Type the following commands to see how you can assign different numbers to different variables, then create a new variable that adds them together:

    ```bash
    dogs = 3
    cats = 2
    total_animals = dogs + cats
    print(total_animals)
    ```
    
    The following output displays, showing you the total number of dogs and cats:

    ```bash
    >>> print(total_animals)
    5
    ```

6. Type the following commands to use the `+=` operator, which handily allows you to increase the value of a number variable by the amount specified:

    ```bash
    dogs += 1
    print(dogs)
    ```

    The following output displays, and we see that `dogs` is now 4 instead of 3:

    ```bash
    >>> print(dogs)
    4
    ```

    Has the value of `total_animals` also increased, to show that we now have 4 dogs and 2 cats? Let's check:

7. Type the following command:

    ```bash
    print(total_animals)
    ```

    The following output displays:

    ```bash
    >>> print(total_animals)
    5
    ```

    `total_animals` still has a value of `5`. This shows us something important: variables do not recalculate their values based on other variables they were created from, unless we explicitly tell them to. We must rerun the statement `total_animals = dogs + cats` to get it to recalculate its value.

    <Message type="tip">
      - You can choose whether to include spaces in your commands or not. `dogs=3` and `dogs = 3` do the same thing.
      - While you're in the Python Interactive Shell, you can skip the `print()` command to display the value of a variable! Just type the variable name and hit enter, and the value will display. You can also use this tip if you want to use the shell as a basic calculator: enter `3+2` and Python will display the result of `5`.

## 5: If statements

This is where things start to get really interesting! If statements are fundamental to a lot of computer programs and scripts. They tell Python to only carry out an action **if** a certain condition is satisfied. Let's try some examples. 

We assume that, as per our previous commands, we already have the variables `dogs` (=4) and `cats` (=2).

1. Enter the following into the Python shell:

    ```bash
    if dogs > cats:
      print("There are more dogs than cats")
    ```

    <Message box = "tip">
      Note the syntax of an **if** statement:
      - The first line contains the condition, in the format: `if` `condition` `:`
      - The second line is indented with a tab or four spaces, and contains the command to execute if the condition is fulfilled.
    </Message>
  
    Hit enter twice after you have finished typing, to make it clear to the Python shell that you don't have any other elements to add to this command.

    The following output displays:

    ```bash
    >>> if dogs > cats:
    ...     print("There are more dogs than cats")
    ... 
    There are more dogs than cats
    ```

    The condition was true -the number of dogs is 4 which is greater than the number of cats (2) - so the print statement was executed. Let's see what happens if we reverse the condition:

2. Enter the following into the Python shell:

    ```bash
    if cats > dogs:
      print("There are more cats than dogs")
    ```

    The following output displays:

    ```bash
    >>> if cats > dogs:
    ...     print("There are more cats than dogs")
    ... 
    >>> 
    ```

    We can see that the print statement is not executed, as the condition is not true.

    Let's add an "else"
