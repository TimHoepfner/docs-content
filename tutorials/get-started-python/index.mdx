This tutorial shows you how to get started with the programming language Python. Python is a great choice if you have never coded before: it's free, it reads like real English and it's fast and simple to learn the basics. What's more, Python often figures in the top three of the most in-demand languages by recruiters.

Read on to learn how to install Python on your computer, and learn and practice some of the basic concepts of this programming language.

## 1: Installing Python

The first essential step is to install Python on your computer - but why, and what does this mean exactly? In order to code with Python, we need our machine to be able to **interpret** Python, that is to say to read our code, check that the code obeys the rules of Python, and carry out the actions we asked for in the code. To this end, we must **install Python** on our machine.

We give you two main options for installing Python:

### Option A: Download and install from python.org

Python.org is the home of the official **Python Software Foundation**, which produces and maintains Python. 

Follow their [beginners guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) to download and install the correct version of the Python interpreter for your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux).

### Option B: Download and install via Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) bundles together the basic Python interpreter with some other useful tools which can make the Python experience more user-friendly, notably:

- **Extra packages** such as NumPy, pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib. At a basic level, you can think of packages like "add-ons", letting you use extra commands and functions in your code that don't come with the basic Python installation. For example, the NumPy package gives you a range of complex mathematic functions and random number generators. 
- **Conda**: a package manager, which makes it easy for you to install and manage other Python packages in the future.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: an application which runs in your web browser, and gives you a user-friendly alternative to writing and running all your code in the terminal command line.

To download Anaconda (and benefit from the Python interpreter plus these extra features), download and install the correct version depending on your operating system [on this page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### 2: Getting ready to code
